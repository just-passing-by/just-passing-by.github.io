			<h5>
			We should really care about protecting your privacy as a visitor to our website, and we will respect the privacy and confidentiality of any information provided by you and adhere to basic privacy principles.<br />
			<br />
			We do not actively ask for, collect, or store any personal information, and any information you provide us will generally be forgotten over the the span of a few hours. However, your information may also be shared with us by third party organisations, which can include social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. They will do so pursuant to their own policies on data protection and privacy. It is a good idea to check out their privacy policies to fully understand how they will process your data before you provide them with your own personal information.<br />
			<br />
			Individual profiles and company details provided in such a manner will not be used for any purpose. Details are only supplied to a third party when it is required by law, or to protect our copyright and other legal rights.<br />
			<br />
			We may passively collect information on or through this or other websites that can personally identify you. For example, we may receive personally identifiable information which you volunteer to us to respond to visitor questions and comments over social media platforms like Twitter. (“Personal Data”)<br />
			<br />
			We will use all reasonable means to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Data while in our possession or control. We will not knowingly share any of your Personal Data with any third party other than our service providers who assist us in providing the information and/or services we are providing to you. To the extent that we do share your personal information with a service provider, we would only do so if that party has agreed to comply with our privacy standards as described in this privacy policy.<br />
			<br />
			Any non-personal information, communications and material you send to this website or to us by email, or which we obtain from third parties without promises of confidentiality, may be kept, used and disclosed by us on a non-confidential basis.

			A cookie is a small file placed in your web browser that collects information about your web browsing behaviour. Use of cookies allows a website to tailor its configuration to your needs and preferences. Although cookies do not access information stored on your computer or any personal information (e.g. name, address, email address or telephone number), they do allow collection of identifiable information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can choose to disable or selectively turn off cookies in your browser settings, prevent advertisements from loading using an ad blocker extension on your web browser, or by managing your web protection settings and/or preferences in other programs installed on your computer (such as Malwarebytes or Norton Internet Security). However, this might affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites, which could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts. So there actually is a downside to rejecting free virtual cookies, but hey, it's your call. <br />
			<br />
			Our website uses cookies to analyse anonymous website traffic and help us provide a better website visitor experience, which could include only showing you a popup once about our use of cookies in your visit. In addition, cookies and other tracking technologies such as web <s>bacon</s> beacons (a.k.a. <s>brownies</s> <s>pixies</s> pixels) may be used to serve relevant ads to website visitors through third party services such as Google Adsense and its partners. Some of these services and advertisers may use their own tracking technologies which enable them to serve ads to you based on your prior visits to TonalRUMP.com and/or other sites on the Internet. Such technologies will allow advertisers to collect information including your IP address, your ISP, your browser information, your operating system, and in certain cases, whether you have flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or for showing personalized ads, which may appear on this website or other websites you visit. <br />
			<br />
			You may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings</a>. Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.aboutads.info">aboutads.info</a>.<br />

Also, we may use your Personal Data to protect the rights, property or safety of TonalRUMP.com or third parties.<br />
			<br />
			If there is a change of control in our website (whether by merger, sale, transfer of assets or otherwise), information that is accessible to us, which may include your Personal Data, could be disclosed to a potential purchaser under a confidentiality agreement. We would only disclose your information in good faith and where required by any of the above circumstances.<br />
